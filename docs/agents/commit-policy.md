# Commit policy

- Follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Scopes are optional.
- Include a `Refs: #<issue-number>` footer in commits for issue branches.
- Apply the commit format and approval policy to every commit, including merge commits; this policy overrides skill defaults.
- Include the proposed message in the review answer's `wait-what` and `humanizer` pass. After approval, use the reviewed message without rewriting it.
- Present verified changes and the proposed message for human review. Ask one question with `Commit`, `Request changes`, and `Reject` options when no decision is pending.
- A `Commit` decision authorizes only the reviewed diff and message for one commit. Apply requested changes, verify them, and present them again. Leave rejected work uncommitted.
